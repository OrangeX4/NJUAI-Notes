function output = my_edgelinking(binary_image, row, col)
%in this function, you should finish the edge linking utility.
%the input parameters are a matrix of a binary image containing the edge
%information and coordinates of one of the edge points of a obeject
%boundary, you should run this function multiple times to find different
%object boundaries
%the output parameter is a Q-by-2 matrix, where Q is the number of boundary 
%pixels. B holds the row and column coordinates of the boundary pixels.
%you can use different methods to complete the edge linking function
%the better the quality of object boundary and the more the object boundaries, you will get higher scores
